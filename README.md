## Read me first

This project is licensed under both LGPLv3 and ASL 2.0. See file LICENSE for more details.

This project has been developed with the latest Oracle JDK, that is 1.8u25. It requires JavaFX 8.

## What this is

This is a GUI application to debug parsers written with
[grappa](https://github.com/parboiled1/grappa).

It uses trace files generated by a parser runner which, as of now, only exists for grappa 2.x which
is under development. A backport to grappa 1.0.x is planned, which should also work for parboiled1.
However, it will require Java 7 to run.
